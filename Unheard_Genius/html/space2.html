                        <p>
                            Before Sputnik.<br>
                            Before NASA.<br>
                            Before humans even dreamed of putting machines in orbit‚Ä¶<br><br>
                            Something may have already been up there.<br><br>
                            Reports of an unidentified satellite‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt belong to any country‚Äîhave been whispered about since the <b>late 1800s</b>, long before spaceflight even existed.<br><br>
                            It‚Äôs been called many things over the years‚Ä¶<br>
                            But one name stuck: <b>The Black Knight Satellite.</b>
                        </p><br>

                        <p>
                            In <b>1899</b>, none other than <b>Nikola Tesla</b> claimed to have picked up <b>repeating radio signals</b> that he believed were not from Earth.<br><br>
                            Years later, in the 1920s and 30s, <b>amateur radio operators</b> also began detecting strange <b>long-delayed echoes‚Äîsignals</b> bouncing back from space with odd, unexplained patterns.<br><br>
                            Many began to believe the echoes were not bouncing‚Ä¶ but <b>being returned intentionally</b>. As if something was <b>listening</b>‚Äîand responding.

                        <h1 class="title1">üõ∞Ô∏è The 1960s: It‚Äôs Spotted</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            In 1960, during the height of the Cold War, the <b>U.S. Department of Defense</b> reported tracking an unidentified satellite in <b>polar orbit</b>‚Äîa type of orbit no <b>country had the technology to achieve</b> at that time.<br><br>
                            It was big. It was dark. It moved in ways Earth satellites couldn‚Äôt.<br><br>
                            They dubbed it ‚Äúunidentified‚Äù and <b>officials never fully explained it</b>.
                        </p><br>

                        <hr color="grey"><br>

                        <h1 class="title1">üì∏ The Mysterious Photograph</h1><br>
                        <p>In 1998, the <b>STS-88 NASA</b> mission to the International Space Station snapped photos of a strange, twisted object floating in low-Earth orbit.<br><br>
                            The images were released to the public‚Ä¶ and conspiracy theorists went wild.<br><br>
                            The object looked <b>unnatural</b>‚Äîalmost like <b>wreckage</b> or a <b>mechanical structure</b>.<br>
                            NASA claimed it was just <b>space debris</b>‚Äîa thermal blanket that floated off.<br><br>
                            But not everyone bought that explanation.<br><br>
                            To this day, many believe the photos captured <b>the Black Knight Satellite itself</b>.
                        </p><br>

                        <hr color="grey"><br>

                        <h1 class="title1">üß† So What Could It Be?</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            There are three major theories
                        </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Ancient Alien Probe</b> The most thrilling idea: That the Black Knight is an extraterrestrial device, possibly thousands of years old, placed here to monitor Earth.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Human Error or Debris?</b> NASA and skeptics claim it‚Äôs nothing more than space junk‚Äîa misidentified piece of metal, possibly from earlier missions.</li><br>
                            <li><b>A Prehistoric Artificial Satellite?</b> Some go further, suggesting the object has been in orbit for thousands of years, far before modern civilization‚Äîleft behind by ancient visitors or a lost civilization far more advanced than ours.</li><br>
                        </ul><br>

                        <hr color="grey"><br>

                        <h1 class="title1">üëÅÔ∏è Why the Obsession?</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            Because everything about the Black Knight defies logic:
                        </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It predates human spaceflight.</li><br>
                            <li>It doesn‚Äôt match any registered satellite.</li><br>
                            <li>Its orbit defies what was technically possible during its first detection</li><br>
                            <li>It may be <b>actively transmitting</b>.</li><br>
                            <li>And NASA‚Äôs official explanation never quite seems to satisfy the believers.</li><br>
                        </ul><br>

                        <p>
                            What if we‚Äôre not alone‚Ä¶<br>
                            Not because someone‚Äôs coming to find us‚Äî<br>
                            But because they already <b>found us‚Ä¶</b> long ago.<br><br>
                            What if something‚Äôs been silently watching us evolve‚Ä¶<br>
                            Listening. Recording.<br>
                            Waiting.<br><br>
                            Maybe the Black Knight Satellite is still up there.<br><br>
                            And maybe it‚Äôs <b>still listening.</b>
