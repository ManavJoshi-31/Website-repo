                <p><i>"If this theory is true, we are not living in the 21st century... but somewhere in the 18th."</i><br>— A Curious Historian</p><br>

                <hr color="grey"><br>

                <h1 class="title1">🧩 The Theory That Time Itself Was Fabricated</h1><br>
                <p>
                    The Phantom Time Hypothesis is a bold and bizarre theory proposed by German historian Heribert Illig in the 1990s. It suggests that nearly 300 years of human history—between 614 and 911 AD—never happened. Not forgotten. Fabricated. Inserted. Entirely made up.<br><br>
                    According to this theory, we're not in 2025. We're actually living in the year 1728. So… what happened?
                </p><br>

                <hr color="grey"><br>

                <h1 class="title1">🏰 The Alleged Conspiracy</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Illig claims that Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, along with Pope Sylvester II, and possibly Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, manipulated the calendar to place themselves at the "prestigious" year 1000 AD.<br><br>
                    Why? Because being the emperor during the turn of the millennium sounds a whole lot cooler than ruling in, say, 703 AD.<br><br>
                    To do this, they allegedly rewrote documents, forged artifacts, and fabricated events—effectively inserting 297 fictional years into the timeline.
                </p><br>

                <h1 class="title1">🗓 The Calendar Problem</h1><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Julian Calendar, introduced in 45 BC, had a slight error causing time drift.</li>
                    <li>In 1582, the Gregorian Calendar corrected this drift.</li>
                    <li>But Illig argues: the correction was too small.</li>
                    <li>By 1582, there should have been a 13-day shift.</li>
                    <li>Yet, only 10 days were corrected.</li>
                    <li>This implies 300 years didn’t really happen. Or so the theory suggests.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <hr color="grey"><br>

                <h1 class="title1">🏛 Suspicious Gaps in History?</h1><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of major archaeological evidence for 614–911 AD.</li>
                    <li>Overlapping figures: emperors and kings from different regions that seem oddly similar.</li>
                    <li>Architectural and cultural stagnation: very little advancement during the "Dark Ages."</li>
                </ul><br>

                <hr color="grey"><br>

                <h1 class="title1">🧪 The Rebuttals</h1><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Astronomical records like Halley's Comet match up with modern calculations.</li>
                    <li>Dendrochronology (tree rings) and radiocarbon dating support these centuries.</li>
                    <li>Thousands of verified documents and artifacts exist across cultures and continents.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, is the theory busted? Maybe. But…</p><br>

                <hr color="grey"><br>

                <h1 class="title1">❓ The Unsettling Possibility</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Even if Illig’s specifics are flawed… it raises a chilling question:<br><br>
                    <b>How much of history do we accept just because it’s written down?</b><br><br>
                    We rely on ancient texts, second-hand reports, and institutions that may have had agendas.<br>
                    If a few powerful people changed history—how would we know?<br><br>
                    ⏳ <b>What if we’ve already lost time… and we’re still losing it?</b><br>
                    Keep questioning. Because the truth may be buried… in centuries that never existed.
