                            Imagine a world where energy is abundant, clean, and completely free ‚Äî no electricity bills, no fossil fuels, and no environmental destruction.
                            Sounds like a utopian sci-fi dream, right?<br><br>
                            But what if that dream was real, and someone intentionally buried it?

                            "Free energy" doesn‚Äôt mean energy comes from nothing. It refers to devices that could, in theory:
                        </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Harness zero-point energy (the vacuum energy present in space itself)</li><br>
                            <li>Tap into electromagnetic fields or gravitational waves</li><br>
                            <li>Operate with extremely high efficiency, requiring minimal input for maximum output</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>
                            Some inventors have claimed to build machines that generate more energy than they consume ‚Äî violating traditional laws of physics, yes, but also threatening the foundations of the modern energy industry.

                            Follow the money.<br><br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Patents are seized under national security orders</li><br>

                            The U.S. government holds over <b>5,000 patents under secrecy orders</b>, many related to energy generation, propulsion, and advanced technologies.
                            Why?<br><br>
                            Under the <b>Invention Secrecy Act of 1951</b>, any patent that threatens ‚Äúnational security‚Äù can be classified and blocked.<br><br>
                            Ask yourself:<br>
                            <b>What kind of invention would be so dangerous it can‚Äôt be shared with the public?</b>

                            What if the global energy crisis‚Ä¶ isn't a crisis at all?<br>
                            What if the solution already exists ‚Äî buried beneath threats, greed, and silence?<br><br>

                            <b>It would change who holds power in the world.</b><br><br>
