                        <p>
                            Throughout history, the world has celebrated a handful of scientists, thinkers, and philosophers — those whose names are immortalized in books, theories, and awards. But what about the others?
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            At Unheard Genius, we believe there’s an entire universe of brilliant minds that were never heard, never seen, or simply ignored. Their discoveries might have been too radical, too early, or too challenging for the mainstream to accept. Some were outcasted, some ridiculed, and some simply forgotten.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Our mission is to resurrect those voices — to give credit where it was never given, and to explore ideas that still have the potential to reshape the way we understand reality.
                            We are creating a space where intellectual misfits, forgotten theories, and unorthodox genius are not only welcome — but celebrated.
