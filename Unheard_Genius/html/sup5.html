                        <p>
                            In the 1950s and 60s, researchers were on the edge of a revolution in mental health.
                        </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>LSD was showing huge potential in treating alcoholism, anxiety, PTSD, and depression.</li><br>
                            <li>Psilocybin (magic mushrooms) helped patients overcome fear of death, find emotional healing, and experience spiritual breakthroughs.</li><br>
                            <li>Therapists reported that a single session could do what years of talk therapy couldn't.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>
                            Human consciousness ‚Äî once a mystery ‚Äî was now being mapped in ways never thought possible.<br>
                            But just as quickly as the research took off‚Ä¶ it was shut down. Hard.
                        </p><br>

                        <p>
                            By the early 1970s, psychedelic research was dismantled, and the substances were labeled Schedule I drugs ‚Äî the same class as heroin.<br><br>
                            The reason? Public panic, counterculture backlash, and claims of psychological harm.<br><br>
                            But here's the catch: Research was already proving these claims wrong.
                        </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No evidence showed psychedelics were addictive.</li><br>
                            <li>Therapeutic outcomes were overwhelmingly positive.</li><br>
                            <li>Researchers were calling for controlled, clinical use, not recreational abuse.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>So why the sudden, aggressive suppression?</p><br>

                            With the shutdown, we may have slammed the door on:

                            Were these visions just hallucinations?<br>
                            Or were these minds tuning in to frequencies long forgotten?

                            In recent years, institutions like Johns Hopkins and MAPS have reignited clinical studies on psychedelics. Results are stunning:
                        </p><br>

                            <li>Terminal patients report peace and transcendence</li><br>
                            <li>Veterans find relief from trauma and nightmares</li><br>

                            But the question remains‚Ä¶<br>
                            What if we had 50 more years of research instead of silence?
