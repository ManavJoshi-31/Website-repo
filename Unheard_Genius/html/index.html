                <p>In every era of human history, there have been minds that saw the world differently—thinkers who dared to question the known, explore the impossible, and imagine beyond the boundaries of accepted science. Yet, many of these individuals, despite their brilliance, never received the recognition they deserved. Their ideas were ignored, buried by time, overshadowed by more popular names, or dismissed simply because the world wasn’t ready for their vision. These are the unheard geniuses—scientists, inventors, and philosophers whose work shaped the foundations of modern thought, often without them ever stepping into the spotlight.</p><br>
                    <p>So why "Unheard Genius"? Because these forgotten pioneers matter. Their stories reflect the true spirit of curiosity and perseverance. By exploring their theories, we not only rediscover knowledge that has long been hidden or dismissed, but we also challenge ourselves to see science and innovation from a broader perspective. Sometimes, the most revolutionary ideas don’t come from the mainstream—they come from the margins, from minds brave enough to think differently.</p><br>
                    <p>This platform is a tribute to those unsung heroes. It’s a place where we revive their legacies, celebrate their theories, and ensure their contributions are no longer whispers in the background but voices that spark curiosity and critical thinking. We believe that uncovering forgotten knowledge can inspire new generations to question boldly, think freely, and create fearlessly.</p>
