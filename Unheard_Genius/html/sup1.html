                        <p>
                            Nikola Tesla wasn‚Äôt just a man ‚Äî he was a mind decades, maybe even centuries, ahead of his time.
                            Born in 1856, he envisioned a world powered by clean, limitless energy, communicated wirelessly across oceans, and controlled through the very fabric of electromagnetic fields.
                            But today, Tesla is more famous as a car brand than as the mastermind who once electrified the world‚Ä¶ and then vanished from its history books.<br><br>
                            <b>Why?</b>
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">üîí Vanishing Blueprints & Seized Secrets</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            When Tesla died alone in a New York hotel in 1943, the U.S. government moved fast.
                            Within hours, the FBI raided his room and confiscated every document, blueprint, and scrap of invention they could find.<br><br>
                            They labeled his ideas ‚Äúpotentially dangerous to national security.‚Äù<br><br>
                            Some of those documents were never seen again. Others? Redacted. Censored. Locked away.<br><br>
                            Even now, the question remains:<br>
                            üîç <b>What did Tesla create that was so powerful, it had to be hidden from the world?</b>
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">‚ö° The Inventions They Don‚Äôt Want You to Know About</h1><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>1. The Wireless Energy Tower (Wardenclyffe Tower):</b><br>
                                A 187-foot tall structure built to beam electricity through the air, no wires needed.
                                Tesla claimed it could power the entire Earth for free.<br>
                                But as soon as investors (like J.P. Morgan) realized they couldn‚Äôt meter or profit from the energy‚Ä¶ funding vanished.
                                The tower was demolished.<br>
                                üîå Free energy? Or free threat to the energy elite?
                            </li><br>
                            <li><b>2. The Death Ray (Teleforce):</b><br>
                                A particle beam weapon Tesla said could wipe out armies from miles away.
                                He offered it to world governments as a ‚Äúpeacekeeping‚Äù tool‚Ä¶ but no one knows what happened to the working model.<br>
                                üëÅ Myth? Or prototype hidden in a vault?
                            </li><br>
                            <li><b>3. Earthquake Machine:</b><br>
                                Tesla built a small mechanical oscillator he claimed could match the natural frequency of the Earth.
                                One test allegedly shook his entire neighborhood ‚Äî and he smashed the device before it went too far.<br>
                                üåç Did he accidentally tap into a technology that could control seismic activity?
                            </li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <p>
                            It‚Äôs easy to write Tesla off as eccentric. But more and more modern discoveries are beginning to validate his ideas.
                            From wireless charging to vibration-based energy to ion propulsion, Tesla may have simply lived in a time that couldn‚Äôt grasp his genius.<br><br>
                            So ask yourself:<br><br>
                            üß† <b>Were Tesla‚Äôs inventions suppressed to protect the public‚Ä¶ or to protect power and profit?</b>
                        </p><br>

                        <p>
                            Maybe the scariest thing about Nikola Tesla‚Äôs inventions wasn‚Äôt what they could do ‚Äî but what they could change.<br><br>
                            üí° What if we already had the answers to climate change, energy crises, and even space travel ‚Äî but they were buried with a man the world chose to forget?<br><br>
                            The future Tesla imagined may still exist‚Ä¶<br>
