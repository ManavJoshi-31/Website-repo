                        <p><i>(Disclaimer: As of now, Bob Lazar is still alive — but conspiracy theories swirl around his alleged assassination attempts and the danger he’s in.)</i></p><br>
                        <p><i>“They want to erase me... not just my story, but my existence.”</i><br>— Bob Lazar, alleged former Area 51 scientist</p><br>

                        <h1 class="title1">👤 Who Is Bob Lazar?</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            In 1989, a man named Bob Lazar appeared on a Las Vegas TV station — face blurred, voice disguised — claiming he had worked on reverse-engineering alien spacecraft at a site called S-4, near Area 51.
                            He described in detail:
                        </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anti-gravity propulsion systems</li><br>
                            <li>A mysterious fuel called Element 115</li><br>
                            <li>Spaceships "not made by human hands"</li><br>
                            <li>A deliberate, government-wide cover-up of extraterrestrial contact</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>
                            As the world watched, Lazar became either one of the greatest whistleblowers of all time… or the most elaborate hoaxer in UFO lore.
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">🕵️‍♂️ The Erased Life</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            After going public, strange things began to happen to Lazar:
                        </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>🗑 His employment records vanished — No trace of him at Los Alamos or S-4</li><br>
                            <li>📚 His educational credentials "disappeared" — no MIT or Caltech records</li><br>
                            <li>🏠 His home was raided by the FBI — years later — under the excuse of a "poison investigation"</li><br>
                            <li>🧠 He claimed he was constantly watched — stalked, followed, intimidated</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>
                            What kind of hoaxer gets government surveillance and repeated raids decades later?
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">💀 The Death Rumors</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            While Bob Lazar is still reportedly alive, conspiracy theorists believe:
                        </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He’s already been killed and replaced by a double to silence the truth</li><br>
                            <li>The FBI raids were cover-ups to retrieve remaining alien tech knowledge</li><br>
                            <li>He has been threatened into silence and now only speaks carefully, choosing his words like a man who knows too much</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>
                            In interviews, Lazar himself admits:<br>
                            <i>“If anything happens to me, you’ll know it wasn’t an accident.”</i>
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">🧪 Element 115: Proof or Propaganda?</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            When Lazar first mentioned Element 115, it wasn’t even on the periodic table. Scientists dismissed it as fiction.<br><br>
                            But in 2003, Element 115 (Moscovium) was officially synthesized. Was Lazar vindicated? Was he truly working with a stable isotope unknown to modern science?<br><br>
                            If so, it would prove he had access to non-human technology… and maybe that’s why he’s a marked man.
                        </p><br>
        
                        <hr color="grey"><br>
        
                        <h1 class="title1">👁 Final Thought</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            If Bob Lazar is lying — why hasn’t the government publicly destroyed his claims?<br><br>
                            If he’s telling the truth — why is he still alive? Or… is he?<br><br>
                            🛸 Could Lazar be a living thread to the greatest cover-up in human history?<br>
                            Or a memory being slowly, quietly erased?<br><br>
                            Either way — his story won’t die… even if he does.
                        </p><br>
